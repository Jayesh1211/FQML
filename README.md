# FQML
The foremost aim of this competition is to inspire participants to pioneer innovative
algorithms, methodologies, and frameworks conducive to the practical implementation
of federated quantum learning using NISQ devices. More specifically, we would like to
concentrate on the following objectives:
● Build a Federated Machine Learning framework for Quantum Computing ML
algorithms. You are welcome to adapt any existing Federated Tools to the
purposes of Quantum Computing.
● You should be able to successfully train QML models – at least simple ones -
using the federated learning framework of your choice or design.
● Develop QML models and algorithms to handle high-dimensional data, such as
images or genomics datasets.
● It is highly encouraged to present your results using Jupyter notebooks with
actual experiments and an explanation of each step.
